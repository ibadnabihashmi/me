            <p>".....(Violins)....yoooouuuu!!!!....You take me down, Spin me around, You got me running all the lights, Don't make a sound, Talk to me now, Let me inside your mind......."
            Oh hey! you're here already, sorry about that, by the way its a nice <a href="https://soundcloud.com/davidguetta/david-guetta-ft-sam-martin-dangerous-robin-schulz-remix-radio-edit">song</a>
            by David Guetta ,you should listen to it,it's alright if you don't. :)
            Who am I? an artist, that can code, make music, and can draw your sketch if you pay me lol, I am joking, only the first one is not free :D
            I don't much like the formal way but for some moment, let me introduce myself to you a little formally, than we can carry on with my casual talk
            So, I am Ebad...<i>wait a minute, why you spelled Ibad when you're Ebad?</i> ok, I should clear that now, officially on my ID card it's Syed Aibad Nabi Hashmi
            <i>Hoooly! now it's 'A' here?</i>yea ,ask my parents for where they produced this 'A',see Aibad, Ebad and Ibad,I'm all three of them, Aibad is official, Ibad is cool and Ebad looks professional.
            and I also dropped writing Syed and Nabi from my name and don't ask about 'Nabi'.So, now it is Ebad Hashmi, like some brand you know :D haha
            Ok, let's go again, I am Ebad Hashmi, Software engineer, Computer Science graduate, did that from FAST-NU, currently working at GFK Etilize private limited as an Associate Software Engineer,
            I am a part time freelancer as well(you can hire me on Upwork I have a good reputation there) and doing this professional coding stuff since I was in sophomore year in my university.
            Worked with several startup, the one good name is Invisume and I am still with Mike and Chad in their long run, besides this I also worked with some cool guys from Silicone Valley, Co-founder of Virgin Mobile USA,
            and i also once failed at my own startup haha.
            I make phone apps, webapps and everything that includes javascript and don't forget java, I do that as well, my love for js is unconditional, javascript is the modern day survival kit which I think everyone should have if you can code.
            where I can make good use of javascript? MEAN apps, react and react native apps, angular, angular2, meteor, electron, Cordova, Ionic, you name it.
